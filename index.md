# Cooper's Web Presence
This is the website of Joel Cooper Daniels. I intend this to be a sort of all-encompassing personal site where I host my resume, personal projects I have worked on, and any writing I have done.  

Definitely not finished yet - check back in the future to see more stuff I've done!

> Everyday it gets a little easier. You just have to do it everyday, that's the hard part, but it does get easier.
